  After graduating high school I took a step back from education and
  worked as a opening/closing manager at a pizzaria for two years. I
  ended up returning to education evidently and ultimatly decided to
  become a web developer after I fell in love with coding. Upon making
  that decision I enrolled and finished a udemy course on full-stack web
  development by Angela Yu, and a full-stack bootcamp offered by the
  loving NuCamp community.`;
