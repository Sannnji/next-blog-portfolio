  graduating high school I took a step back from education and worked as an opening/closing manager 
  at a pizzeria for two years. I ended up returning to education evidently and ultimately decided to 
  become a web developer after I fell in love with coding. Upon making that decision, I enrolled and 
  finished a Udemy course on full-stack web development by Angela Yu, and a full-stack boot camp 
  offered by the loving NuCamp community.`;
