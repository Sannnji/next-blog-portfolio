Rune Tool is an app intended for Diablo 2 players who have minimal existing knowledge of the game's rune mechanic.
The tool displays craftable rune words depending on the user's inventory. The site also features a quickly accessible
rune wiki.

## Motivation

As a big fan of the Diablo franchise, I pre-ordered Diablo 2: Resurrected and played it the moment it was released.
But because I hadn't played Diablo 2 in quite a long time, I lost all of my knowledge on the game's rune crafting
mechanic. So like anybody else, I turned to Google for help. That's when I thought, "Wouldn't it be fun and cool to
make a tool to tell you what rune words were craftable based on your inventory? And along with that, it also
had a quickly accessible and concise rune wiki?".

## Challenges

I had a few hiccups while implementing the back-end because I wanted to try out Axios and MongoDB without Mongoose, 
but overall this project was pretty simple. Writing the function to check a user's inventory for craftable runes was 
a breeze, as it was reminiscent of a code challenge I had solved a while back. And the front-end was designed to be 
simple, but yet informative. So I didn't have any issues there either.
