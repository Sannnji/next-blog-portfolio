decompose. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is

Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. God creates 
dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man 
creates Dinosaurs. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? They're
