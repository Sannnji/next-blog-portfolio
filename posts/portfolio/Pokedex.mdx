Pokedex is an application that categorizes, filters, and displays pokemon information. By default, the app
queries pokemon by their respective generation. Any additional filters used will be based on the results
of the generation filter. ( All intellectual property belongs to Nintendo, and shout out to everyone who helped
develop PokeApi. ) Any inaccuracies can be reported to PokeApi's git repo.

## Motivation

I grew up as a big fan of the pokemon games. And like many others who grew up playing pokemon, I constantly
referred to a third-party site/guide for information on pokemon. "When does my Piplup evolve? What does the
shiny version look like?" Well, Serebii will tell you. This site had every ounce of information on pokemon,
the games, show, trading cards, and probably more. I loved the website and used it whenever I needed it, and
still do to this day. However, I always wished they had a better way to search pokemon besides using a select
tag for each generation. That's why I made this application. I wanted to make something more visually
pleasing and easier to navigate. Because I don't know about you, but I find it easier to spot Pikachu from rows of
pokemon box sprites than a select tag's list of names.

## Challenges

Surprisingly, the biggest challenge I faced while building this application was figuring out how to
implement evolution logic. Due to how the authors of the API structured the data, getting each pokemon's
previous evolution and next evolution ended up being a bit of a head-scratcher. The issue was that I wanted
to receive the full evolution tree no matter which pokemon I selected within that tree. For example, if I
queried Charizard, I wanted it to return the previous evolution (Charmeleon) and the evolution previous to
that one (Charmander), and vice versa. Since I planned on returning a pokemon object from the evolutions
queries to receive their respective sprite, I decided to query evolve-from and evolve-to on themselves within
the pokemon query.

## Afterthoughts

There are still a couple of features/changes I'd like to add, like routing, animations, additional data, and
refactoring. But I'm pretty happy with how the site turned out and the current state of it. While I still
have a lot of room for improvement in best practices and algorithms, I had a lot of fun building this project
and am proud of how far I've come.
