This post assumes a basic knowledge of NextJS and Markdown. For this is not a tutorial, but a blog about
what I learned while creating this site and how awesome it was.

## Background

While I was browsing portfolio sites a week ago, I found that many of them included a blog section where the author
would document their journey as a developer, and I thought that would be a great feature to implemnt on to my own site.
Initially I attempted to implement the feature using my current knowledge on the MERN stack. The plan was to
create a back-end along with a seperate (secret) site where I would submit my posts, but I ended up deciding against
it becasue of Google ðŸ˜‚. Long story short, I was trying to figure out how others went about highlighting keywords and
displaying code blocks, and upon googling I became aware of **Markdown** and **NextJS**, along with
the amazing synergy betweem them.

## The Markdown and NextJS combo wombo

Now that I was using NextJS and Markdown, I no longer needed a backend. Why? Because thanks to NextJS I
was able to use the **fs** node-module within their server-side functions that are ran on build time, which in hand also allowed
me to store Markdown files within my project directory and retrieve data from them. After that, all I had to
do was use a package called **gray-matter** to turn the string of data into a JSON format.

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join("posts/blog"));

  const posts = files.map((filename) => {
    const markdownWithMeta = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join("posts/blog", filename),
      "utf-8"
    );

    const { data: frontmatter, content } = matter(markdownWithMeta);
    const preview = content.substring(0, 150) + "...";
    return { frontmatter, preview };
  });

  return { props: { posts } };
}
```

Just like that, I now have an array of post objects returned from **getStaticProps** to pass into my component
at build time.
Isn't that awesome?! Guess what though? There's more!

<br />

## Slugs

On top of the server-side functions, I was also made aware of the powerfull file-based routing that comes along with NextJS.
I was now able to create pages dynamically for each post by creating a **[slug].js** file inside a blog folder within pages.
And to link them together I added this line of code inside the **getStaticProps** function I made before and
returned the value within each post object.

```javascript
const slug = filename.replace(".mdx", "");
```

Now I set the href inside NextJS's link component within the component I passed the post object into.

```javascript
import Link from "next/link";

...
<Link href={`portfolio/${post.slug}`} passHref>Read More</Link>
...
```

Then inside the **[slug].js** file I add the following to define a list of paths that have to be
created at build time. 

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join("posts/blog"));

  const paths = files.map((filename) => ({
    params: {
      slug: filename.replace(".mdx", ""),
    },
  }));

  return { paths, fallback: false };
}
```

Now that the links finally are connected to their respective posts and the paths are being created at build time,
we can add a **getStaticProps** function inside **[slug].js**, and pass the slug from  **getStaticPaths** to get that
specific posts data to display in our component.


```javascript
export async function getStaticProps({ params: { slug } }) {
  const markdownWithMeta = fs.readFileSync(
    path.join("posts/blog", slug + ".mdx"),
    "utf-8"
  );

  const { data: frontmatter, content } = matter(markdownWithMeta);
  const mdxSource = await serialize(content);

  return { props: { frontmatter, mdxSource } };
}
```
